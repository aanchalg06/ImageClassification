## Image Classification with Native Neural Networks API
This Android application demonstrates image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented through Android's Native Neural Networks API. The app allows users to load images either from the camera or from a file and then runs a CNN model to predict the classification of these images.

## Features
Image Loading: Provides functionality to capture images using the device's camera or select images from the gallery.
Native Neural Networks API: Utilizes Android's native support for running neural networks efficiently on device hardware.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implements a CNN model for image classification.
Prediction: Processes loaded images through the CNN model to predict their classes.
User Interface: Includes an intuitive interface for image capture or selection and displaying prediction results.
## Technologies Used
Android SDK: Development platform for creating the mobile application.
Kotlin: Primary programming language used for Android app development.
Android CameraX API (Optional): For capturing images using the device's camera.
Android Storage Access Framework: Allows users to select images from the device's gallery.
Native Neural Networks API: Android framework for running neural networks on device hardware efficiently.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Machine learning model for image classification.
